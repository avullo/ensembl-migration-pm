if we can do for it, we have a procedure for the production DBs
enquire DBA

05/08 HW ready at EBI

- production

-- software running
Have all the SW installed (on RH6)
Need a reconciliation between RH6/7. Should meet with Andy
Goal: making it as simple as possible for the teams.
Making sure the teams have tested the pipelines 

-- staging at the EBI
First we move the live websites
About when we move production, something to discuss with Dan S (timeline), what he needs for that to happen, should be in charge
need to set a date and tell the other teams

-- machines set up
creating VMs, making sure people can use them. 
11/08 requested HW to DBA, TSC ask to submit form, Andy Y to do it

05/08 HW ready at EBI

- HW procurement
Initial purchase HW ready
At the moment there are enough resources 

Next ensembl purchase

- datacentre shutdown
email about details shutdown, use it to remind significant things to various teams

web
mostly taken care by Steve & C.
possible disaster recovery plans - ongoing
possible weekly slot with Steve to get updates?

15/08 
users/tools DB should be ready in one week/before shutdown at most (Harpreet to be probed in time)
web servers on suicidal blades should be ok, can use old/new HW (how?) and recreate services easily(?)
AWS-EBI VPN (for accounts) working 

production
staging3 too slow, back to staging1/2, systems have not yet come up with a solution
Dan S to be probed about reverting back to non suicical after production ends most of its business
Teams know which machines are on suicidal, make sure they run things on non faulty HW (mostly genebuilder),
