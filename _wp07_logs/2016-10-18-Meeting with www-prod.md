Request for advice on set up.

What we need from our dev environment is:

(i) able to isolate our sandboxes from other developers (not happy with the idea of everyone having write access to my directory);

(ii) git push and pull (will require us to enter our passwords on every commit)

(iii) ability to customise login environments (require us to set environments with scripts, which again will be writable by everyone)

After the meeting, it was recognised that all the potential blockers aren't actually.
We'll get 30GB of local disk per VM and enough nfs storage which is ok until the middle of next year. 

Requesting for a virtual user for each developer (4/8 requested so far).
