- We cannot have a dev VM with our new home and storage areas mounted on it for 'some weeks'. We could have one with the old areas now though. We really really need to get going on this so it'd be good if we could use the old areas and get building localsw ASAP. Q - are there any existing accounts that we could use for this ?

- We have an FTP site at EBI and now need to test a mirror server for FUSE.

- RT ticket about Solr. Major point is that, like the web VMs, if we want to use the new storage areas we will need to wait. I think we should wait.

- Request for info about our LSF setup has been be moved to System Infrastructure.

- Not heard anything about how we should be using our gold storage.
