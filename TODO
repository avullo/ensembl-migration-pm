migration meeting
contact Dan S about production/shutdown
- shutdown from the perspective of production
  - 86 work will be finished, genebuilders might be running some pipeline, they're aware they have to use non-faulty HW
  - we're back to staging 1/2, be sure to go back to non-suicidal before shutdown
  - Micheal raised a point: storage is not affected, but how to recover the mount points from faulty machines in case they don't survive? Should we take note of these?
  - lustre warehouse not affected , pipelines can continue safely
- we have?
  - 100TB of clustered file system (lustre, total usage ATMO is 43TB) attached to HX farm. Can use 'our share' of the 5PB Lustre just published
  - 300TB of NFS/medium storage areas (longer term warehousing for lustre's processes backups, currently at 200TB including the flat-file stores)
  - NFS area attached to HX farm (/nfs/software/ensembl ensw rw access only) for software installation (RH7)
  - HW request form sent to request production HW
- we need
  - strategy for moving warehouse
  - DB server move, version strategy? when, who, how?
- timeline for migration, what he need for that to happen, should be in charge, need to set a date and tell the other teams

18/08/2016
meet Steve in the morning (to become regular, eventually)
- FTP: who/when do the transfer, test FTP/HTTP/rsync servers?
- ensembldb transfer going at full speed? ETA, how about warehouse/nfs data move? public MySQL affected only by FTP for shutdown? transferred where?
- shutdown from web perspective: user/hive dbs at EBI (VPN with AWS OK, shadowland with Sanger OK?, internal network links? DMZ?, what else?, web servers (moved to non suicidal then recreated? can we wait the overhead, has been tested?), archives (remain at Sanger, access user/hive at EBI via shadowland?), FTP (will be moved, also for mirrors, deadline?), public MySQL (?), shutdown temporary failover/long-term solutions


migration meeting with Sanger: catch up on how the data and VM migration is going and whether there are any issues
- transferring ensembldb, status? can be used to load the archive DB
- FTP: internal beta testing enabled for FTP/HTTP/RSYNC, data move?
- HW request form for production machines?
- archives: data moving (81-85 left out at the moment?) Pbs. with 67 instance, Luke to update on Friday, Dan suggests rsync directories out of running instance to blank one. Asked archive immediately before/after that one
