HX is full, HH is only at 3Tb since the (ongoing) copying there is much much slower than that to hx.

DBA to request more space. The 10TB was on the basis of the 8.6TB envisaged at the beginning of this ticket. I would suggest 15TB to accommodate releases 88 and 89, and beyond that moving to a shard-based system the same as planned for sql5.

That'll take us around June.
