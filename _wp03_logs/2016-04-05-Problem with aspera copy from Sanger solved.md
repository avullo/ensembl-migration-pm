Problem with aspera copy from Sanger solved (wrong permission on ftp user folder). Successfully transferred release 82/83 FTP data. Data in subdirectories with symlinks has not been copied, need to take that into account when setting it up. Asked systems to set up FTP service, need some time to do that.
