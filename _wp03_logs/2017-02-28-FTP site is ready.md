The ensembl.org domain is not yet with EBI, so switching would require both Sanger and EBI web teams to make changes. A further is that the DNS is in the process of being transferred to EBI - Sanger have provided records and EBI are currently trying to import them.

Web and production teams  have agreed to wait to move until the DNS migration has finished.
