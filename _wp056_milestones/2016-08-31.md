- Production HW ready at EBI, request submitted (available after shutdown)
- staging3 too slow, moves back to suicidal blades with backup to genebuild9
- long-term (RH7) software environment almost ready
- pipelines tested (RH6):
  - core 100%
  - variation 70%
  - regulation 0%
  - genebuild 10-25%?
  - compara no testing, wait RH7 (software is main issue)
