Andy C informed us the HW provision does not include the requested storage for FTP (~100TB), which will be covered when the Sanger grant starts in October.
Pb is that we would like to migrate the existing FTP content before that date, for which we would need ~35TB. Andy told us we would need to speak with Pete J to see if it's possible to find a temporary solution.
