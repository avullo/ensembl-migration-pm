==========
- Production HW ready at EBI, request submitted (available after shutdown)

- Farm infrastructure ready:
  - clustered file system attached to HX farm. 100TB of lustre storage attached to HX farm. 	Can use 'our share' of the 5PB Lustre just published.
  - NFS/medium-term storage areas. 300TB of NFS available storage hosted in HX (longer-term warehousing, since lustre lacks any kind of backup). mount point at /nfs/ensemblarch/?
  - An NFS area attached to HX farm at /nfs/software and an area made available under /nfs/software/ensembl with write access only to the user ensw
  - Compute requirements: 500 CPU yrs farm processing on Sanger farm. Can use the ebi cluster as is for that, has plenty of free cpu capacity.
  - Long term software environment (RH7) almost ready, /nfs/software/ensembl, Andy to teach us how to use

- Transferring warehouse via shadowland soon, mount point ready but not yet available for members (to be discussed soon)

- Discussing migration plan, will communicate soon

- Clean up DB servers

- Shutdown:
  - production work (almost) finished (mart build left), staging back to suicidal
	(1) We'll announce that we're shutting down processes on staging-1/2 on Thursdy afternoon and all pipelines need to finish by then
	(2) We'll copy everything from staging-1/2 to ens-staging3 on Thursday afternoon
	(3) We'll cross our fingers that staging-1/2 come back to life, but need confirmation from systems that they'll be able to source a suitable replacement in a day or two in the event it doesn't come back.
  - use non faulty HW if you have work you want to do
