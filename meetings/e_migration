- Gracefully survived shutdown:
  - a number of VMs have come back with different IPs
  - minor pbs with Solr servers (java process stopping e! tomcat)
  - some IBM blades have not come back and others had trouble with storage: new system boards with more memory, all blades back to service Aug 31 evening
- HW requisition: no update from EBI systems
- Warehouse: not enough space at EBI to host Sanger warehouse with public MySQL/FTP/NFS data, will move after these have been transferred
- Clean up DB servers?	
- Move home directories/lustre space?
- Archives:
  - uploading archive/search Sanger instances to Embassy
  - db/mart data files copied to EBI warehouse, to be copied to Embassy asap
- FTP:
  - data transfer to EBI warehouse, should be finished this week
  - internal beta testing now enabled for FTP/HTTP/RSYNC
  - aim to migrate end 2016
- Public MySQL:
  - data transfer (ensembldb/martdb) to EBI warehouse completed
  - layout agreement (failover HH/HW), following eg-publicsql.ebi.ac.uk set up with the expectation of production taking over routine updating
  - request for 2 x 5 VMs with appropriate disk
  - aim to switch DNS in autumn (Oct/Nov)
- Outreach
  - RT migrate week Oct 17-21

- Production HW ready at EBI, request submitted (available after shutdown)

- Farm infrastructure ready:
  - clustered file system attached to HX farm. 100TB of lustre storage attached to HX farm. 	Can use 'our share' of the 5PB Lustre just published.
  - NFS/medium-term storage areas. 300TB of NFS available storage hosted in HX (longer-term warehousing, since lustre lacks any kind of backup). mount point at /nfs/ensemblarch/?
  - An NFS area attached to HX farm at /nfs/software and an area made available under /nfs/software/ensembl with write access only to the user ensw
  - Compute requirements: 500 CPU yrs farm processing on Sanger farm. Can use the ebi cluster as is for that, has plenty of free cpu capacity.
  - Long term software environment (RH7) almost ready, /nfs/software/ensembl, Andy to teach us how to use

- Transferring warehouse via shadowland soon, mount point ready but not yet available for members (to be discussed soon)

- Discussing migration plan, will communicate soon

- Clean up DB servers

- Shutdown:
  - production work (almost) finished (mart build left), staging back to suicidal
	(1) We'll announce that we're shutting down processes on staging-1/2 on Thursdy afternoon and all pipelines need to finish by then
	(2) We'll copy everything from staging-1/2 to ens-staging3 on Thursday afternoon
	(3) We'll cross our fingers that staging-1/2 come back to life, but need confirmation from systems that they'll be able to source a suitable replacement in a day or two in the event it doesn't come back.
  - use non faulty HW if you have work you want to do
