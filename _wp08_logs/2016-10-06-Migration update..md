Tim to start export early Oct 24, it should take ~8hrs plus additional time it takes to prepare VMs.

Sunny can possibly start the import on Tuesday, let it run it's course and then update some configurations and do some checks after import, once happy release the queued emails. It's possible everything can be finished by end of Wednesday.
