Shawn on holiday Oct 3-14. Unavailable on October 22nd as well. The weekend of October 14-16th would work better for him if it's open. Otherwise he's fully available the weekend of October 28-30th, or we could try to do the migration on October 21-23rd and deal with his unavailability (a colleague can replace him on Sat).

Sent an email proposing Oct 17-23 dates otherwise shift to Oct 24-30
