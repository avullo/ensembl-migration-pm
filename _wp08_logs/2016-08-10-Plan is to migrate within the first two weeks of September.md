EBI wants to start the consulting process (get as much of the planning and any issues)
Tim Cutts from Sanger is on holiday and back end of August

Areas of concerns which may already be covered in the Remote Professional Services RT contract

(A) Possible to decrease the export time? We would like to keep the 
total downtime to no more than 48 hours.

(B) A method to accept or queue replies to open Sanger tickets into EBI 
RT during the export/import and merge or attach them to the appropriate 
imported ticket.

(C) Solve the database conflicts as described above.

(D) Develop email handling code to manage Sanger ID tickets (capture in 
a custom ID) to new EBI ticket ID.
