NFS data is copying.

67 export and reboot continue to fails, we have to create a new VM and copy 67 data there (can clone 82). Luke to provide 73 instance soon.

Trying to set up reverse ssh tunnelling for archive EBI-Embassy data move, doesn't work.
Should be doable with port forwarding, seems it needs set up of iptables. Dan S claims there's a simple way to specify via command line ssh.
