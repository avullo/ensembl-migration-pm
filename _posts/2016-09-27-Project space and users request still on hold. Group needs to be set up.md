Currently ens_pub and it's owned by Paul Kersey. We really want machines up asap. Spoken to Paul K and he's happy with some transfers of ownership.

If we want all new things separate we might ask for users:
ensweb_adm, w3_ensweb01, tc_ensweb01

But before doing that you should ask for the group ensweb_pub

The group can't be requested through the web interface 
so we might need to contact desktop directly.

After the group is created you might request the users and then the the 
storage area.
