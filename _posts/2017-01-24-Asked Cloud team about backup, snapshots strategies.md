This could be done programmatically using the vCloud REST API, and it can be done while the machines are running.

On the other hand, taking snapshots of a machine doesn't mean these are available as resources which can be downloaded as stored somewhere separate from Embassy. Once you've taken a snapshot you can revert the machine to it, but only using the menu on the vCloud interface. The snapshot is stored internally.
