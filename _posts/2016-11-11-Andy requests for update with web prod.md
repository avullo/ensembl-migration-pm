i) *Very important*. Traffic manager entries for Embassy (#98380) - has been going along OK but I've no confirmation that we're good to go next week.

(ii) web dev VM (originally #98774 with sysinf, now in email with Simone and Andrea)
There are two types of storage to consider here. The existing one, which is obviously in production and ready and the new, untested GPFS storage that is being configured. Using the latter is going to take longer than using the former. Web prod cannot re-prioritise this.

Web team to progress with the current storage solution and aim to have our production system on the new GPFS system.

(iii) Review our requirements with them so that we can rethink our plans if necc. #98549 and #98831. Also emailed Rich Boyce directly about gold disc. 

(iv) Request the rest of the VMs. The highest priority ones will be those for the most complex services; can't give a hit list until we've done (iii)
