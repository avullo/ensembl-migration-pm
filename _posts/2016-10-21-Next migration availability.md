Shawn cannot make the 11-th and BP doesn't have an engineering resource available the weekend of 11/11; available the three other weekends in November: 4-6, 19-21, 25-27. Sunny not available Sunday 27th or Monday 28th.

The next available weekend with BP support and Tim's availability is 25-27 November. If Tim is able to get export data ready by ~5pm Friday, Sunny starts import ~6pm and by Saturday ~12 noon (18 hours) import should complete. Sunny then have Saturday afternoon/evening to complete post import configs/tests and turn the RT service back on. 

Need to reschedule with BP.
