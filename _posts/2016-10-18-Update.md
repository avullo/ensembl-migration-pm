Tim has written code which (a) will update the Sanger email aliases correctly on the day and (b) creates undo LDIF entries so that I can undo everything if it all goes wrong for whatever reason.

The DBA's may have identified the issue that is causing the long import time. They are going to get another test rig setup for Sunny to import into and I will test and report back the results.
