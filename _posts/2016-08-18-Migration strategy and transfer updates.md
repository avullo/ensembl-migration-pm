Migration strategy: ask/set up two services/2 servers, request 2 VMs each in HX/HH (fail over), upgrade to 5.6 from 5.1 at EBI, keep MySQL 4 (need to request). Aiming at e!86 (Sep 20), how about GRCh37?

Copying the data from martdb (ensembldb2b) to EBI, same approach as ensembldb, should take <1w.
