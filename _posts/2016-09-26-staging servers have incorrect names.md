Dan made the request to:
- upgrade mysql-ens-reg-prod-1.ebi.ac.uk to 4 CPU, 32Gb RAM
- create a new instance, mysql-ens-reg-prod-2.ebi.ac.uk, with the same specs as the upgraded mysql-ens-reg-prod-1.ebi.ac.uk
The machines are mysql-gti-sta-1 and mysql-gti-sta-2 and should be renamed to mysql-ens-sta-1 and mysql-ens-sta-2 respectively.
Dan made the request to DBAs.
