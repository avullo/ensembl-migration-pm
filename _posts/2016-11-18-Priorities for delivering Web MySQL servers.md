Highest priority: accounts, sessions, tools and the various ensembldb instances

After that, the five 'species&compara'. 

Having these first will be most usefull for us in developing our deployment procedures and also for setting up the internal load balancing 

Timelines:

accounts, sessions, tools, ensembldb - before Xmas

remainder (minus two) - end of Jan

final two (mysql-ens-web-archive and mysql-ens-web-archive-mart) - April
