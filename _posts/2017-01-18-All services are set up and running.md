Cloud team has provided a number of 15TB volumes attached to the VMs.

All data is there and the services are running. LB set in HH to direct access on different instances based on port, with fail over to HX.

Remaining issue is to how users access to these. No anonymous user so far, so public access can't be tested.

The service is expected to be fully migrated out of Sanger by the time e!88 is out (18/03).
