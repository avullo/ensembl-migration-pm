Clustered file system attached to HX farm. 100TB of lustre storage attached to HX farm. Can use 'our share' of the 5PB Lustre just published.
NFS/medium-term storage areas. 300TB of NFS available storage hosted in HX (longer-term warehousing, since lustre lacks any kind of backup)
An NFS area attached to HX farm at /nfs/software and an area made available under /nfs/software/ensembl with write access only to the user ensw

Compute requirements
Use 500 CPU yrs farm processing on Sanger farm. Can use the ebi cluster as is for that, has plenty of free cpu capacity.
