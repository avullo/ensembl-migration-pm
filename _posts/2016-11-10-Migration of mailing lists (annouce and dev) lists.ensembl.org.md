Sent email to Desktop. We would want to migrate these to EBI. We want to maintain the current separate domain for lists.ensembl.org to ensure we show external users only relevant lists and provide appropriate archives.

Should be easy to move.

1) disable email alias delivery?
2)  export list
3) import list
4) re-enable mail deliver

Sanger still hosts the MX records. These too needs to move the ebi
