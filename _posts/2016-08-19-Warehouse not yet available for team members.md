Warehouse not yet available for team members, archive policy/targets haven't been addressed yet, call meeting
Steve: We have a 10TB volume for the backups of the FTP datafiles*. That's virtually full and given that it's likely to grow much larger I'd like to move away from multiple areas each of fixed size. We have also ended up squeezing files onto different partitions and adding symlinks to make the full use of the available space, not great. One large partition feels better, but I don't know what the storage team would advise
