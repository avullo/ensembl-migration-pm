Look out for:

- checking tickets are there
- checking the queues have the right number of tickets in them
- prod some tickets to make sure they look “ok” i.e. correspondences/comments and ticket history are there (you may not be able to email at this time).

It might be good idea to record some of the numbers (i.e open tickets) at around 5pm Thursday this is when Sanger will stop accepting tickets (if you have access to them - see below). I don't have access to Sanger RT to note them down.
