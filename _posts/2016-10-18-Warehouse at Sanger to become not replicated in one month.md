Sanger will start moving its warehouse storage to its new home shortly. Ensembl warehouse we will not be moved since we are moving it EBI. Once Sanget starts using the new storage ours will still be available in the Sanger data centre but will no longer be replicated. 
The no replication means your data on the old warehouse storage will be the only copy of the data.  (On the current system there have never been backups, only replication of the data in two places.). 

As such it will be at risk and need to start moving to EBI asap.
