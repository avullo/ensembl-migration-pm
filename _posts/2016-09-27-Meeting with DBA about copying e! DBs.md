Need to support file-system level copying using the ensmysql virtual user between the following instances (Andy B knows the details here). Since these are currently unused, the rebuild will be very quick so it can go ahead whenever DBAs are ready:
mysql-ens-sta-1
mysql-ens-sta-2
mysql-ens-var-prod-2
mysql-ens-core-prod-1
mysql-ens-compara-prod-2
mysql-ens-compara-prod-3
mysql-ens-biomart-prod-1
mysql-ens-reg-prod-1
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-3
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-4
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-5
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-6
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-7
mysql-gti-dev-2

For the following instances, there are dbs and processes already present. 
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-1
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-2
mysql-ens-var-prod-1
mysql-ens-compara-prod-1
mysql-gti-dev-1
mysql-gti-pan
mysql-ens-tark-dev-1 

Dan sent a message to the team to stop using these instances until further notice
