15/08 HW request form (production servers) sent, likely to be available after shutdown

05/08 HW brought into production

15/07 FTP/farm/warehouse HW ready: some already available, some covered by late purchase

14/07 Next ensembl purchase for FTP/farm/warehouse: put in a request to Pete J for the following

- 50TB FTP in HH (with appropriate scale-up, need failover at HX)
we'd like FTP to have as much uptime as possible (we load flat-files from the FTP site into many of our live tools).
- 100TB lustre in HX (total usage ATMO is 43TB)
- 300TB NFS in HX (replacing warehouse at Sanger currently at 200TB including the flat-file stores)
- 500 CPU yrs farm processing (to be costed up)
- /nfs/software mount to be made available to the HX farm (where I will install our software packages for farm processing to)

==> Can satisfy the request now, necessary purchases can be done at a later time (before end of year).

Detailed purchase requirements:

FTP Requirements
================

1). FTP in HH (R/O) with space in HX (R/W). 75TB is perfect. Please go ahead with a 1 hour mirroring cycle as you suggested below. From what Mag says we can have this possibly by today? To confirm this will provide an FTP and HTTP server (see later for future near-term requirements)

Disk Requirements
=================

2). Clustered file system attached to HX farm. 100TB of lustre storage attached to HX farm
Available
3). NFS/medium-term storage areas. 300TB of NFS available storage hosted in HX
Available
4). An NFS area attached to HX farm at /nfs/software and an area made available under /nfs/software/ensembl with write access only to the user ensw
Available

Compute Requirements
====================

5). Farm compute supplement attached to HX farm. As we said before we use about 500 CPU years of compute on the Sanger farm. Can we have a rough costing of a set of nodes that may be able to deliver such a level of compute? If there's an algorithm we should apply to the Sanger compute to get a rough sensible figure back to you
Available

Future FTP Requirements
=======================

6). The current ftp.ensembl.org is available over an rsync connection. We believe a number of our users currently use rsync as their transfer protocol. In addition we believe there is interest in accessing our data over globus grid ftp. Is there a possibility of having our LDC FTP disks made available over these protocols in addition to the FTP and HTTP servers currently requested? 
Asier? working on it

07/07 Hardware is on-site and being brought into production. Awaiting 4 weeks for this.

05/07 The 70TB of Embassy storage that Ensembl have purchased is now ready. 

29/06 HW procurement is well ahead, hypevisor CPU/RAM resources available. Storage expected to become available in one week, after that it takes 4-5 weeks for the complete set up.
HW provision does not include the requested storage for FTP (~100TB) and requirements for shared NFS capacity/cluster usage, which will be covered when the Sanger grant starts (Oct). Need to speak with Pete J to find solution

11/05 Everything's approved in writing, proceed with the order

09/05 WT gives Paul F a verbal and emailed ok regarding the budget plan which is confirmed £250K from the Ensembl grant and the remainder from EMBL funds.

06/05 We have quotes required for HW purchases to satisfy the VM needs. This excludes the requirements for shared NFS capacity and cluster usage which are to be confirmed by Ensembl team.
There are two purchases required for VM needs, one for the hypervisors (servers) and one for the storage. Need to pass on delivery details to whomever places the orders.

19/04 System team has taken requirements, defined by data centres and divided by storage requirements, and is currently working with storage systems (devising the type of devices etc). They need to go back and forth with the vendor before going for a configuration that can be handed over to the vendor (which can come back very quickly). In two weeks, 3 quotes (will say delivery time with price and we can do that within that date), then engage with purchasing systems (long time).
There's a certain level of flexibility should an under specification occur. Lack flexibility only when we buy something for different data centres.

07/04 Paul talked to the Trust which shows to be receptive to the idea of purchasing with current grant funds plus EMBL funds that we "reimburse" from the new grant after 1 October. The programme officer will discuss this with the appropriate finance officer at the Trust and we should have confirmation that this is ok by next week.

05/04 plan suggested by the grants office (Emma):
- buy in compute on the Ensembl overhang budget currently ~€325k (~£250k) creating a ~£150k shortfall
- EBI creates a pre-award to push the shortfall into
- once the new award is available in October we then charge the EBI pre-award cost centre to the new WT award
