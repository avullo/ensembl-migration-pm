Hi all,

Andy has generated a flow diagram showing the different components of 
Ensembl. Here are my thoughts on what to present, taking a slightly 
different slant:

We have five services - website, search, userdata, logins and tools. 
What are we prepared to accept in terms of availability of each of these 
? The first two need 100% availability, userdata currently has 100% but 
we could live with less (could we?), for the other two we currently 
accept downtime. In the long term I would like there to be a roadmap by 
which all five can eventually have 100% availability.

We currently have monitoring of each of the below at the system level

The components of each of these services are below

Meet to talk about it at 1-30 ?

Website

- ~2.5Tb r/o databases. Note access to filesystem needed for deployment 
and post release fixes

- ~10Tb (and growing) files. r/o if /nfs or r/w if FUSE. The latter, 
which is there on the mirrors, introduces a dependency on the FTP site.

- 100's Gb of pre-generated cached data on r/o local disc (but again we 
need to be able to update these post-release)

- r/w database for sessions ( a few Gb), needs backups and replication.

- r/w file system for temporary files (images and logs). Size...?

- no backups are essential for any of the above apart from sessions

- email server

- growing dependency on REST

- load balancing, for both webservers and databases


Search

- ~500Gb r/w local disc - write needed for the deployment procedure - 
replication by URL - and also solr locks)

- ~ 10's Gb of r/w temporary space (logs)

- load balancing


Userdata

- r/w filesystem of 100Gbs with backups (and replication if we want 100% 
availability)

- accessible by post-Embassy archives


Tools

- ~100's Gb r/o filesystem (can be r/o as long as we pregenerate VEP 
index files)

- LSF cluster with r/w filesystem with backups (and replication if we 
want 100% availability). Size...?

- ~100Gb r/w database with backups (and replication if we want 100% 
availability)

- VPN access for mirrors

- accessible by post-Embassy archives


Logins

- 10Gb r/w database with backups (and replication if we want 100% 
availability)

- VPN access for mirrors and Embassy
