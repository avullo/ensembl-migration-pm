Completed creation and partial configuration of the archive 82 servers: MySQL servers for species/mart, NFS server, www and search instances. 82 databases copied by DB team from mysql-ensembl-mirror/mysql-ensembl-mart-mirror EBI mirrors.

Not enough space for a complete configuration capable of hosting all archives, e.g. db servers contains just enough space for a release. NFS server runs on 2TB, needs ~12TB.
