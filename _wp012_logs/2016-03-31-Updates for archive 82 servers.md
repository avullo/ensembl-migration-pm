Sanger has provided updates for the archive server. Previous image was still containing traces of Sanger-based configuration.

Problems uploading the new image or any image from Sanger using ovftool ("Error: cURL error: Couldn't connect to server"). Requested help to Sanger but cannot help at the moment.
