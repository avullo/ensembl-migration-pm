Need to check that the VMs running are configured to the latest VM Hardware version to
avoid problems with vMotion. Currently most part of the machines in emsembl tenancy are running VM HW version 8 and they should be updated to 10. The process to update them implies to power off the machine and change the HW version on the properties.
