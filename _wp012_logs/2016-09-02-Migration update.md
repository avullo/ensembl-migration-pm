The process works for 73 (web and solr are both good) then we should be confident that it's going to to work for 74 - 85 (excluding 82).

Steve has requested all 74-85 images. Dan is away next week 
Plan is to go live with all of these from Embassy at once, as soon as we can. We're not yet ready with that though after having problems transferring some images to Embassy, so the 85 archive will need to be served from Sanger. I am therefore putting in a request to Luke today for two more VMs 

73 instance ready to be uploaded, includes solr instance as well, /lustre/scratch109/ensembl/av4/migration

Dan has successfully uploaded and booted the 73 instances
