Status: 90%

August 2016. 90%

Shutdown: not really affected, does not involve anything with the suicidal blades apart from the web db servers which have to be migrated to EBI

Actions: copy 81-85 (excl. 82) archive db data from EBI (ask Andy B & C.)

Status: done

January 2016. 100%
Request made

2. Requisition MySQL database servers (version 5.1.58) for data hosting and user sessions (must exceed 2TB and ability to grow by x20). Need to have separation between mart and other databases. Copy 79-83 data to the machines from EBI mirror.

Status: 95%

Action: what does Steve mean by data hosting? enquire, request data to EBI DBAs

Develop procedures to synchronise this with the /nfs volume at WTSI

Status: 92%

Dan S properly configure NFS server

? 2016.
NFS instance with minimal set up on Embassy vCloud. Minimal space available?

Actions: check current disk on NFS server attach more if necessary, enquire about synchronisation procedures

4. Develop alternative to PFETCH
Ensembl Genomes already have bindings to dbfetch and so may be a drop in replacement

Status: ?

Actions: enquire about

5. Retrieve machine VMWare image from WTSI and host in Embassy
- 1 for web server - install Perl modules if required

Note that it is critical that we can transfer the images - recreating them from scratch would be very difficult (webservers) or almost impossible (search servers)

Status: 100%
