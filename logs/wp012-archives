2016-10-20 Search 85 uploaded, not enough resources to instantiate it
Requested more CPU/memory (10GHz, 32GB) to take into account search 86 as well.

2016-10-19 Search archive machines EBI-ified
The search machines have all been EBI-ified, and we should be able to get to them all via bastion with the usual details, via ssh.

The next thing Dan needs to do is to sort out the ownership of the search server processes (we want to move them all to the single www-ens user) and then he can start firing up individual apaches and tomcats and see what the services look like.

2016-10-18 Search servers configuration
Dan is recreating www-ens, updating www-ens password, enabling www-ens login, www-ens can su, su requires password, passwordless ssh from bastion, only one key authorized, password auth disabled, disable root shell, set hostname, and adding to dns.

74-84 done.

2016-10-17 Search 85 cannot be exported
Luke made several attempts with no success. He may have to just download the VMDK files (600GB) and we may have to create the server from scratch in the embassy cloud and attach the VMDK files to new VM.
 
2016-10-13 Uploaded 85 web instance to Embassy, 86 cloned from 85

2016-10-12 Archive machines update
All 14 of the web machines boot successfully now, and have been updated with the network configuration, accounts, passwords, etc, on each per the setup at EBI.

The remaining big tasks are to do the same for the search machines and
to bring up ensembl on each of them.

2016-10-12 Data transfer of 74,75,78,80 archives finished
Remains 86

2016-10-11 Embassy copy problems debugged, resumed rsync for 74,75,78,80,86
Tracked down the cause of problem to be a misconfiguration of the physical switches connected to the Embassy Cloud hosts

2016-10-11 Requested 85 images, deleted 73 from Embassy
The 73 archive was retired last week.
Once 85 instances are uploaded, clone them to be able to prepare the 86 archive on Embassy

2016-10-07 martdb 86 transfer to Embassy completed

2016-10-07 Debugging storage problems on main archive server

2016-10-06 Started ensembldb/martdb release 86 copy to Embassy

2016-09-28 ensembldb copy update
79 finished

2016-09-26 ensnfs copy to Embassy finished
ensembldb completed: 73,76,77,81,83,84,85
ensembldb remaining: 74,75,78,79,80 (pbs with 74,75,78,80).

2016-09-22 martdb copy to Embassy finished

2016-09-20 martdb copying to Embassy started
Total size is 13TB, done 6TB.

2016-09-19 ensembldb copy to Embassy restarted
Total size is 18.3TB, done 8TB.

2016-09-16 ensembldb copy stopped for the week end
ensdb-web-archive has 30TB provisioned and it's sitting in a 9TB datastore. The cloud team needs to move the three disks to another datastore with a bigger capacity.

2016-09-15 More memory on Embassy
An extra 144GB has been given to instantiate all search instances

2016-09-14 All search instances have been uploaded to Embassy
Cannot instantiate all of them, run out of configured memory resources
 
2016-09-13 75-78 search instances uploaded
EBI cloud team got feedback from VMWare, retrying upload, it works (VMWare did some db maintenance tasks).
Proceeding with remaining instances.

2016-09-13 Started NFS data transfer to Embassy
Again, rsync process died, restarted

2016-09-12 Started transferring archive db data to Embassy
rsync process died with uninformative message:

rsync: writefd_unbuffered failed to write 4 bytes to socket [sender]: Broken pipe (32)
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (1508 bytes received so far) [sender]
rsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.c(600) [sender=3.0.6]

rsync restarted

2016-09-12 Still problems uploading search instances
Cloud team enquire VMWare for uploading problems

2016-09-08 Upload images update
75-84 archive instances uploaded

74 search instance uploaded

Problems uploading search instances, cloud team increased quota but with no effect

2016-09-07 74 archive uploaded

2016-09-03 Creating 74-84 OVAs
Luke's creating 74-84 archive/search instances

2016-09-02 Request for 74-85 images
The process works for 73 (web and solr are both good) then we should be confident that it's going to to work for 74 - 85 (excluding 82).

Steve has requested all 74-85 images. Dan is away next week 

2016-09-02 Migration update
Plan is to go live with all of these from Embassy at once, as soon as we can. We're not yet ready with that though after having problems transferring some images to Embassy, so the 85 archive will need to be served from Sanger. I am therefore putting in a request to Luke today for two more VMs 

73 instance ready to be uploaded, includes solr instance as well, /lustre/scratch109/ensembl/av4/migration

Dan has successfully uploaded and booted the 73 instances

2016-09-01 Martdb copying to warehouse finished

2016-08-24 NFS data is copying
NFS data is copying.

67 export and reboot continue to fails, we have to create a new VM and copy 67 data there (can clone 82). Luke to provide 73 instance soon.

Trying to set up reverse ssh tunnelling for archive EBI-Embassy data move, doesn't work.
Should be doable with port forwarding, seems it needs set up of iptables. Dan S claims there's a simple way to specify via command line ssh.

2016-08-23 Archive databases at EBI
Archive databases for embassy are all at /nfs/ensemblarch/db/ensembldb, although updates will be needed for 86.
Mart dbs are not there yet.

Options for moving to Embassy:
- NFS mount main archive DB disk on bastion host (slower)
- ssh tunnelling through bastion host (reverse SSH tunnel)

transfer can start now but Embassy will be shut down soon. If we use rsync we can resume

2016-08-22 /nfs/ensemblarch/ensnfs ready
NFS server will probably need 15-17TB storage, currently 10TB. Allocated extra storage

2016-08-19 Luke's last attempt
Luke's last attempt: shutdown 67 and try to clone again. Requested 73 image.

Ask to migrate all in one go: less complex in terms of usage/service monitoring, also save having to make piecemeal changes to DNS

Steve asked warehouse subdir /nfs/ensemblarch/ensnfs to store NFS data

2016-08-18 Updates
Luke's on holiday, Paul to contact him about our issues next week. 

NFS data move. Mark was to propose solution (12/07), can possibly use shadowland like ensembldb

2016-08-17 How to solve the boot problem
Dan proposes to do an rsync of our directories out of the running instance into a blank one. Asks if we could go with other archives in the meantime, no reply

2016-08-16 Reinstalled main archive servers
Reinstalled main archive servers, expanded storage (mart server also). Luke to update on Friday. Can wait shutdown

2016-08-10 Steve transferring ensembldb files
Steve transferring ensembldb files. can use them to load the archive DB server, how about nfs data move?

2016-08-08 Luke to investigate why some images don't boot

2016-07-12 NFS data move 
Mark Flint: possible route for the NFS data, via transfer, need to come up with a security policy for that route, and know what the IP addresses at EBI end will be. caveat: right now, only addresses in the 10.7.0.0/16 range are possible for us to connect to.

2016-07-07 Archives should be out of Sanger in the next 2-3 months pending more work by the webteam

2016-07-05 The 70TB of Embassy storage that Ensembl have purchased is now ready

2016-05-24 No progress yet on the requested archive images
Problems with uploading OVA images from the Sanger farm. This wasn't an issue with the first attempt using archive 82. 

2016-04-20 Sanger is setting up requested archive (36/67) images

2016-04-19 Security based access to Embassy trial available
Security based access to Embassy trial available. Can only ssh in via "bastion" host. From that machine there is password less ssh, via a key stored there, to any other machine. If necessary for rsync, scp, etc, we can use port forwarding via the bastion. Now moving onto logging and reporting in this package next.

We will not get any extra disc storage for Embassy in the short term. There is none available on the architecture our VMs are on and we will only have more to move our instances to when we've had hardware procured. We will therefore be a bit longer getting into production with this (there's not enough nfs even for the 82 archive).

2016-04-10 Web update on archives
Web team reasonably confident embassy migration approach will work for e71 onwards. At the moment, they don't know about the two older ones (e54, e67).
Requested to Sanger VM OVAs for Ensembl 54 and 67 archives.

2016-04-08 Archive 82 successfully set up on Embassy
Archive 82 successfully set up on Embassy. Checked the basic pages, sessions, search and biomart, but not yet looked at the more obscure pages which rely extensively on helper applications, nor at flat files.

After archive 82 successful set up, the plan is try to focus on more "target" archives with different operating systems.

Ensembl Version 54 (called ensembl-archive-36), is an etch machine(!) and so is only six years past the date when debian stopped providing security updates. As well as migrating this to EBI, it might be worth us seeing if we can push this forward at least a release or so. It might not be easy, but worth trying. We're only exposing port 80, so we mainly need to make sure httpd and nginx are watertight (most, but not all of the attack surface). Ensembl version 67 (ensembl-archive-67) is a lenny box. Also worth a go with. (A mere four years without security updates).
From 73 onwards we are on ubuntu precise, which isn't EOL for another year yet, the same as the existing trial of 82.

2016-03-31 Updates for archive 82 servers
Sanger has provided updates for the archive server. Previous image was still containing traces of Sanger-based configuration.

Problems uploading the new image or any image from Sanger using ovftool ("Error: cURL error: Couldn't connect to server"). Requested help to Sanger but cannot help at the moment.

2016-03-17 Creation/configuration of archive main/mart servers
Completed creation and partial configuration of the archive 82 servers: MySQL servers for species/mart, NFS server, www and search instances. 82 databases copied by DB team from mysql-ensembl-mirror/mysql-ensembl-mart-mirror EBI mirrors.

Not enough space for a complete configuration capable of hosting all archives, e.g. db servers contains just enough space for a release. NFS server runs on 2TB, needs ~12TB.

2016-02-10 Solr OVA import successful
Successfully upload Solr search instance OVA into Embassy from Sanger using ovftool. VM quite big (~650GB).

2016-02-04 Solr instance OVA available
Solr search instance OVA available to upload. Image is big (~200GB), impractical to upload from laptop.

2016-02-02 OVA import successful
Successfully imported test OVA as vApp template into vCloud director on Embassy. 
Small image (~8GB), unfolds into 46GB disk VM. Used laptop, need to do that from Sanger.

2016-01-28 Archive 82 OVA ready
Sanger has made the test OVA for the archive 82 server ready.
