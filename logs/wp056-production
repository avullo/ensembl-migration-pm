Shutdown: staging3 too slow, back to staging1/2, systems have not yet come up with a solution 
Dan S to be probed about reverting back to non suicical after production ends most of its business
Teams know which machines are on suicidal, make sure they run things on non faulty HW (mostly genebuilder), 

-- software running
Have all the SW installed (on RH6)
Need a reconciliation between RH6/7. Should meet with Andy
Goal: making it as simple as possible for the teams.
Making sure the teams have tested the pipelines 

-- staging at the EBI
First we move the live websites
About when we move production, something to discuss with Dan S (timeline), what he needs for that to happen, should be in charge
need to set a date and tell the other teams

-- machines set up
creating VMs, making sure people can use them. 

19/08 warehouse not yet available for team members, archive policy/targets haven't been addressed yet, call meeting
Steve: We have a 10Tb volume for the backups of the FTP datafiles*. That's virtually full and given that it's likely to grow much larger I'd like to move away from multiple areas each of fixed size. We have also ended up squeezing files onto different partitions and adding symlinks to make the full use of the available space, not great. One large partition feels better, but I don't know what the storage team would advise 

18/08 pipeline tests status (RH6):
- core 100%
- variation 70%
- regulation 0%
- genebuild 10-25%?
- compara no tests, wait RH7 (software is main issue)

17/08 form submitted, will likely be available after shutdown. warehouse data transferred soon (follows ensembldb)

11/08 requested HW to DBA, TSC ask to submit form, Andy Y to do it

05/08 HW ready at EBI (production/web), FTP/farm will be covered soon by a late purchase
300TB NFS archive area created and mounted on /nfs/ensemblarch

26/07 the new /nfs/software is available on the cluster

15/07 Disk requirements
Clustered file system attached to HX farm. 100TB of lustre storage attached to HX farm. Can use 'our share' of the 5PB Lustre just published.
NFS/medium-term storage areas. 300TB of NFS available storage hosted in HX (longer-term warehousing, since lustre lacks any kind of backup)
An NFS area attached to HX farm at /nfs/software and an area made available under /nfs/software/ensembl with write access only to the user ensw

Compute requirements
Use 500 CPU yrs farm processing on Sanger farm. Can use the ebi cluster as is for that, has plenty of free cpu capacity.
