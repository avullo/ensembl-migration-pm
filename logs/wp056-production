22/08 created /nfs/ensemblarch/warehouse for data move
300TB warehouse is not enough to accomodate ensembldb/mart/ftp/nfs and actual Sanger warehouse alltogether. warehouse will probably move later
cannot move staging to ens-dump for the shutdown, as it does not have enough room to build mart (deadline Sep 2), the disk on ens-dump had limits in the attached disk size.
Sanger systems could reattach the storage from st-1/2 to different machines.

Plan:
(1) We'll announce that we're shutting down processes on staging-1/2 on Thursdy afternoon and all pipelines need to finish by then
(2) We'll copy everything from staging-1/2 to ens-staging3 on Thursday afternoon
(3) We'll cross our fingers that staging-1/2 come back to life, but need confirmation from systems that they'll be able to source a suitable replacement in a day or two in the event it doesn't come back.

19/08 warehouse not yet available for team members, archive policy/targets haven't been addressed yet, call meeting
Steve: We have a 10TB volume for the backups of the FTP datafiles*. That's virtually full and given that it's likely to grow much larger I'd like to move away from multiple areas each of fixed size. We have also ended up squeezing files onto different partitions and adding symlinks to make the full use of the available space, not great. One large partition feels better, but I don't know what the storage team would advise 

18/08 pipeline tests status (RH6):
- core 100%
- variation 70%
- regulation 0%
- genebuild 10-25%?
- compara no tests, wait RH7 (software is main issue)

17/08 HW request form submitted, will likely be available after shutdown. warehouse data transferred soon (follows ensembldb)

11/08 requested HW to DBA, TSC ask to submit form, Andy Y to do it

05/08 HW ready at EBI (production/web), FTP/farm will be covered soon by a late purchase
300TB NFS archive area created and mounted on /nfs/ensemblarch

26/07 the new /nfs/software is available on the cluster

15/07 Disk requirements
Clustered file system attached to HX farm. 100TB of lustre storage attached to HX farm. Can use 'our share' of the 5PB Lustre just published.
NFS/medium-term storage areas. 300TB of NFS available storage hosted in HX (longer-term warehousing, since lustre lacks any kind of backup)
An NFS area attached to HX farm at /nfs/software and an area made available under /nfs/software/ensembl with write access only to the user ensw

Compute requirements
Use 500 CPU yrs farm processing on Sanger farm. Can use the ebi cluster as is for that, has plenty of free cpu capacity.
