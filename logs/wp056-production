2017-02-08 warehouse is readonly

2017-02-07 updates on warehouse
There are some areas coming out of warehouse volumes that are differently named, and these areas will be affected by making the volumes read0-only:

- /warehouse/ens-variation01
- /warehouse/ensdb_arch_wh07
- /warehouse/exalead_wh01
- /nfs/ensnfs-webdev  (this area comes from your wareghsoue space, but was mounted onto NFS to give path continuity)

/warehouse/vectorbase has not being used by the vectorbase team recently. This is free to go readonly. They might want to have a poke at it once this is moved to EBI. Same thing with /warehouse/ens-variation01

web is happy for /warehouse/exalead_wh01 to be RO and asked for /nfs/ensnfs-* to be left alone for the moment.

2016-12-06 Geneguild do not need lustre data space
Eventually, things which they might need can be regenerated rather quickly

2016-11-25 All prod instances running on ext4 filesystem

2016-11-24 All genebuild prod servers are running ext4 filesystem now, other servers to be upgraded as well
xfs has fragmentation problems

2016-11-17 Finalizing optimization of delivered servers
Currently genebuild and biomart building servers

2016-11-08 First regulation instance upgraded

2016-11-08 genebuild-prod machines reconfigured with increased connection limit

2016-11-07 Monitoring MySQL hosts
Elastic Beats could be an option, might be worth trying out for monitoring by Ensembl staff once we have virtual users to connect to the new machines. 

2016-11-07 Second regulation instance mysql-ens-reg-prod-2 now available

2016-11-03 Increased number of cores on mysql-vm-072
They are all still being fully utilised without any appreciable IO workload, and the load on the server is not dropping but rather seems to be increasing. There is still 12 GiB free RAM on the server, don't think increasing the RAM would be useful without any indications that it would be used for anything other than filesystem cache.

An increase in connection limit for all genebuild machines is expected for tomorrow.

2016-11-02 Meeting with DBA
List of actions:

- Andy B/Rich to increase cores on mysql-ens-compara-prod-1 to 8 and Matthieu to monitor and report back
- Andy B to reparameterise all new machines according to planned usage
- Andy B to increase connection limit to 1024 on mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-1 and mysql-ens-variation-prod-2 and Thibaut/Sarah to test pipelines and report back
- Dan S to contact sysinf about cactus monitoring on MySQL servers
- Andy B to look into requests for upgrading mysql-ens-reg-prod-1 and creating mysql-ens-reg-prod-2 (tickets #95173 and #90611) and Alessandro to add these to the spreadsheet
- Dan S to look into separate server dedicated to hive and tuned for InnoDB only

Manuela and Andy B had a meeting with Pete Jokinen and it is feasible (and already in use at EBI) a mechanism to place a condition based on load for LSF to decide about throttling. AndyB and Pete will work on this over the next days and get back to use asap.

2016-10-24 Pipeline tests update
- variation dbSNP import
- some production pipelines successfully tested

Genebuild about to start their tests even with no increase connection limit.

Regulation is running the production process at EBI with the aim of moving the data back to Sanger once completed.

2016-10-21 Request to increase connection limit
Dan has made the request, as several of the Ensembl teams have requested an increase in the number of concurrent connections for the mysql-ens-compara-prod-n and mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-n machines to 1024. They say that is required for their pipelines, with most connections sleeping at any time, with a maximum of several hundred active connections. 

2016-10-21 Warehouse copy to EBI
ens_srch_01 done (will need updating for 87: www and grch37), now copying ensembl-0[1-3]

2016-10-20 Warehouse copying to EBI started
Copying legacy databases from ensdb_arch_wh01, ie those that predate ensembldb.

Sarah to clean up ensembl_variation_wh01 soon

2016-10-19 Sanger has deleted old accounts data from warehouse
Data is copied to ensembl10/archived as a backup

2016-10-18 Warehouse at Sanger to become not replicated in one month
Sanger will start moving its warehouse storage to its new home shortly. Ensembl warehouse we will not be moved since we are moving it EBI. Once Sanget starts using the new storage ours will still be available in the Sanger data centre but will no longer be replicated. 
The no replication means your data on the old warehouse storage will be the only copy of the data.  (On the current system there have never been backups, only replication of the data in two places.). 

As such it will be at risk and need to start moving to EBI asap.

2016-10-04 Machines now configured with file-system level copying with ensmysql

2016-09-27 Meeting with DBA about copying e! DBs
Need to support file-system level copying using the ensmysql virtual user between the following instances (Andy B knows the details here). Since these are currently unused, the rebuild will be very quick so it can go ahead whenever DBAs are ready:
mysql-ens-sta-1
mysql-ens-sta-2
mysql-ens-var-prod-2
mysql-ens-core-prod-1
mysql-ens-compara-prod-2
mysql-ens-compara-prod-3
mysql-ens-biomart-prod-1
mysql-ens-reg-prod-1
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-3
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-4
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-5
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-6
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-7
mysql-gti-dev-2

For the following instances, there are dbs and processes already present. 
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-1
mysql-ens-genebuild-prod-2
mysql-ens-var-prod-1
mysql-ens-compara-prod-1
mysql-gti-dev-1
mysql-gti-pan
mysql-ens-tark-dev-1 

Dan sent a message to the team to stop using these instances until further notice

2016-09-26 Insufficient regulation servers specs 
Dan made the request to:
- upgrade mysql-ens-reg-prod-1.ebi.ac.uk to 4 CPU, 32Gb RAM
- create a new instance, mysql-ens-reg-prod-2.ebi.ac.uk, with the same specs as the upgraded mysql-ens-reg-prod-1.ebi.ac.uk

2016-09-26 staging servers have incorrect names
The machines are mysql-gti-sta-1 and mysql-gti-sta-2 and should be renamed to mysql-ens-sta-1 and mysql-ens-sta-2 respectively.
Dan made the request to DBAs.

2016-09-23 Production HW available
Dan to:
- check with DBAs if same virtual user for file system access that we have on the test servers will be available;
- ask sysinf to mount /nfs/software on all login nodes (only ebi-006 at the moment)
- set up ro/rw users on these VMs
- set up mysql-cmds on /nfs/software/ensembl (no brew)

2016-09-19 HW provision update
Issues with the request for the staging server: a machine with such specs
needs to be hosted on a different hypervisor. This is also blocking the provision
of all the remaining VMs as EBI prefers to do that in one go.
The EBI team is looking into providing a suitable solution.

2016-08-23 Shutdown update
Sanger Hinxton Data Centre Shutdown starts at 5:00pm 26/08
Farm systems are expected to be back from 1:00pm on Tuesday 30th August

The long, parallel and hugemem-restricted queues will be set inactive today ~5pm
All queues will be closed to jobs at around 5:00pm on Thursday 25th August.

2016-08-22 Created /nfs/ensemblarch/warehouse for data move
300TB warehouse is not enough to accomodate ensembldb/mart/ftp/nfs and actual Sanger warehouse alltogether. warehouse will probably move later
cannot move staging to ens-dump for the shutdown, as it does not have enough room to build mart (deadline Sep 2), the disk on ens-dump had limits in the attached disk size.
Sanger systems could reattach the storage from st-1/2 to different machines.

Plan:
1. We'll announce that we're shutting down processes on staging-1/2 on Thursdy afternoon and all pipelines need to finish by then
2. We'll copy everything from staging-1/2 to ens-staging3 on Thursday afternoon
3. We'll cross our fingers that staging-1/2 come back to life, but need confirmation from systems that they'll be able to source a suitable replacement in a day or two in the event it doesn't come back.

2016-08-19 Warehouse not yet available for team members
Warehouse not yet available for team members, archive policy/targets haven't been addressed yet, call meeting
Steve: We have a 10TB volume for the backups of the FTP datafiles*. That's virtually full and given that it's likely to grow much larger I'd like to move away from multiple areas each of fixed size. We have also ended up squeezing files onto different partitions and adding symlinks to make the full use of the available space, not great. One large partition feels better, but I don't know what the storage team would advise 

2016-08-18 pipeline tests status (RH6)
- core 100%
- variation 70%
- regulation 0%
- genebuild 10-25%?
- compara no tests, wait RH7 (software is main issue)

2016-08-17 HW requisition update
HW request form submitted, will likely be available after shutdown. warehouse data transferred soon (follows ensembldb)

2016-08-11 HW requisition update
Requested HW to DBA, TSC ask to submit form, Andy Y to do it

2016-08-5 HW ready at EBI
HW ready at EBI (production/web), FTP/farm will be covered soon by a late purchase
300TB NFS archive area created and mounted on /nfs/ensemblarch

2016-07-26 The new /nfs/software is available on the cluster

2016-07-15 Disk requirements
Clustered file system attached to HX farm. 100TB of lustre storage attached to HX farm. Can use 'our share' of the 5PB Lustre just published.
NFS/medium-term storage areas. 300TB of NFS available storage hosted in HX (longer-term warehousing, since lustre lacks any kind of backup)
An NFS area attached to HX farm at /nfs/software and an area made available under /nfs/software/ensembl with write access only to the user ensw

Compute requirements
Use 500 CPU yrs farm processing on Sanger farm. Can use the ebi cluster as is for that, has plenty of free cpu capacity.

2016-06-01 cvs.sanger.ac.uk is turned off

2016-05-26 CVS transferred from cvs.sanger.ac.uk to EBI. 
CVS repository copied across from Sanger and hosted in:
/nfs/production/panda/ensembl/sanger-cvsroot

We also have a tarball in:
/nfs/production/panda/ensembl/sanger-cvsroot.tar.gz

Transfer done using scp (no rsync) and with no checks on file integrity. Total size is 31GB
Can checkout projects from CVS locally but with write access enabled.


2016-04-01 CVS at Sanger becomes read only
