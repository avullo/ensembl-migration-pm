2016-09-27 Project space and users request still on hold. Group needs to be set up
Currently ens_pub and it's owned by Paul Kersey. We really want machines up asap. Spoken to Paul K and he's happy with some transfers of ownership.

If we want all new things separate we might ask for users:
ensweb_adm, w3_ensweb01, tc_ensweb01

But before doing that you should ask for the group ensweb_pub

The group can't be requested through the web interface 
so we might need to contact desktop directly.

After the group is created you might request the users and then the the 
storage area.

2016-09-22 Request for two virtual users and project space for the e! website at EBI.
admin user: ensweb_adm
web user: w3_ensweb01
group: ensweb_pub
Read only project space: /nfs/public/ro/ensweb
Read/write project space: /nfs/public/rw/ensweb

Update: ens_adm02 and w3_ens02 to keep the same name style with the numbers being the first available ones.

2016-09-16 Web topology agreement
This has been discussed at a meeting between TSC and the web team about EBI deployment. The focus was fitting into existing practice and figuring out where special cases will occur and flagging for further investigation.

2016-09-08 Request for web dev environment on hold

1) /nfs space for ensemblweb, both rw and ro
2) A virtual user (not needed for the sandboxes of course, but this should be the owner of the /nfs volumes)
3) A shared group for webteam members and the virtual users

This is better talked to TSC leaders, meeting next Tuesday (13/09).
