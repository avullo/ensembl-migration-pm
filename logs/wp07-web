2016-09-08 Request for web dev environment on hold

1) /nfs space for ensemblweb, both rw and ro
2) A virtual user (not needed for the sandboxes of course, but this should be the owner of the /nfs volumes)
3) A shared group for webteam members and the virtual users

This is better talked to TSC leaders, meeting next Tuesday (13/09).
Steve hangs off requesting sanbox VMs
