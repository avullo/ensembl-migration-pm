issue: old version of Mysql running there
which ones are we going to updgrade to 5.6, and how
if we can do for it, we have a procedure for the production DBs
enquire DBA

18/08 copying the data from martdb (ensembldb2b) to EBI, same approach as ensembldb, should take <1w
Migration strategy: ask/set up two services/2 servers, request 2 VMs each in HX/HH (fail over), upgrade to 5.6 from 5.1 at EBI, keep MySQL 4 (need to request). Aiming at e!86 (Sep 20)
how about GRCh37?

10/08 Steve transferring ensembldb files using shadowland to EBI warehouse, will complete ~2w

22/07 the internal Sanger mirror only has 2-3 releases. The only place we have it all is ensembldb2a|b in the DMZ, will take about 2.5 - 3 weeks

21/07 can use internal ensembldb mirror, we can copy that at the full 10G rate. That just leaves the biomart data from the DMZ which is a smaller data set. This will reduce transfer time greatly (Paul Bevan)

05/08 HW from initial purchase ready at EBI, need to send form for request

15/07 300TB warehouse ready, can receive ensembldb/martdb files from Sanger
