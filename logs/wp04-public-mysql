10/08 Steve transferring ensembldb files using shadowland to EBI warehouse, will take?

22/07 the internal Sanger mirror only has 2-3 releases. The only place we have it all is ensembldb2a|b in the DMZ, will take about 2.5 - 3 weeks

21/07 can use internal ensembldb mirror, we can copy that at the full 10G rate. That just leaves the biomart data from the DMZ which is a smaller data set. This will reduce transfer time greatly (Paul Bevan)

05/08 HW from initial purchase ready at EBI, need to send form for request

15/07 300TB warehouse ready, can receive ensembldb files from Sanger
