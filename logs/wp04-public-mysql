2016-09-02 Migration update
ensembldb/martdb - we have the data here and we are in contact with the EBI DBAs, but at this moment we can't be sure of being able to run these services from EBI in time for the next release (86) due in 3 weeks time. Plan is therefore to release 86 on Sanger and migrate as soon after that as we can. 

Steve has requested meeting with EBI DBA to figure out how to deploy instances now that we have data and HW

2016-08-24 ensembldb transfer finished
ensembldb transfer finished, archive databases for embassy are all at /nfs/ensemblarch/db/ensembldb.
mart DB transfer still going.

2016-08-18 Migration strategy and transfer updates
Migration strategy: ask/set up two services/2 servers, request 2 VMs each in HX/HH (fail over), upgrade to 5.6 from 5.1 at EBI, keep MySQL 4 (need to request). Aiming at e!86 (Sep 20), how about GRCh37?

Copying the data from martdb (ensembldb2b) to EBI, same approach as ensembldb, should take <1w.

2016-08-10 ensembldb data transfer
Steve transferring ensembldb files using shadowland to EBI warehouse, will complete ~2w.

2016-07-22 ensembldb transfer updates
The internal Sanger mirror only has 2-3 releases. The only place we have it all is ensembldb2a|b in the DMZ, will take about 2.5 - 3 weeks.

2016-07-21 ensembldb transfer updates
Can use internal ensembldb mirror, we can copy that at the full 10G rate. That just leaves the biomart data from the DMZ which is a smaller data set. This will reduce transfer time greatly (Paul Bevan).

2016-08-05 HW ready
HW from initial purchase ready at EBI, need to send form for request

2016-07-15 Warehouse ready to accept DB files
300TB warehouse ready, can receive ensembldb/martdb files from Sanger
