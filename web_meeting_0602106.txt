Release 88 Mar 7, if that happens, we might set a date to migrate the release to EBI ~ Mar 28
Compara is the main blocker for getting e!88 in time (Mar 7)
Need a strategy for that, for sure about:
- update mirrors (RH6, localsw)
- migration of GRCh37 (Mar 7 at the very latest, even if e!88 happens after)
  need to speak to production about getting Mart ready
  anyway, no big deal if mart is not ready

pre is the first one to go, very quickly after 37 then live

Steve to speak with Simone about the request for the VMs
